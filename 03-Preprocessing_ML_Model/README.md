# Project: Human Resources Dataset Analysis

## Overview
In the third week of this project, the focus shifts to **Data Preprocessing**, **Machine Learning Model Selection**, and **Model Training, Validation, and Testing**. This phase is crucial for building predictive models that can help understand and forecast employee retention.

## (1) Data Preprocessing

Before applying machine learning models, the data needs to be cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Although the dataset was mostly clean, any remaining missing values were handled by appropriate imputation techniques or removal.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables such as `Gender`, `BusinessTravel`, and `JobRole` were encoded using methods like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding** to make them usable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Scaling**: Continuous variables such as `Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `Age` were normalized using standardization techniques to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, ensuring that a separate portion of the data would be used to validate the model performance.

## (2) Model Selection and Training

After preparing the data, the next step was to choose a suitable machine learning model. Several models were considered:

- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for binary classification, predicting whether an employee will leave (`Attrition`).
- **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method known for handling large datasets and providing good accuracy with less overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Applied for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)**: Considered for its performance in structured/tabular data like HR datasets.

We used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the models and select the best performing one based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## (3) Model Validation and Testing

After training the selected models, we validated their performance using a validation set. The following steps were taken:

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the models was evaluated on the validation set using metrics like **Accuracy** for classification.
- **Testing**: The final selected model was tested on an unseen test dataset to ensure that it generalizes well and performs accurately in predicting employee attrition.

## Tools Used

- **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, seaborn)**: For data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and testing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting the entire process and results.

## Deliverables:
- A fully processed dataset ready for modeling.
- A trained and tested machine learning model capable of predicting employee attrition.
- A detailed notebook documenting the preprocessing, model selection, and testing process.
- App
The third week of the Human Resources Dataset Analysis project successfully established a robust machine learning pipeline, ensuring that the data was properly prepared, and the best model was selected to predict employee retention with high accuracy. This phase sets the foundation for deploying the model in real-world scenarios.
