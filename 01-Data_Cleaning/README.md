## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
After building the data model, we proceeded with data cleaning and preprocessing. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key observations:

- The data had no missing values or unusual entries across all tables. Each field, such as age, salary, and years of experience, showed values within expected ranges.
- Data entries for categorical variables like gender, marital status, and job roles were consistent without any spelling or formatting issues.
- Date fields, such as the employee `HireDate` and `ReviewDate` in the performance review table, were in the correct format and adhered to the expected chronological order.
- Numeric fields, including `Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `DistanceFromHome`, were confirmed to contain only valid numbers without any outliers or inconsistent values.

## Conclusion
The dataset was found to be clean, free of errors, and consistent with the designed data model. The foreign key relationships worked as expected, linking employee details to education levels, satisfaction levels, and performance RatingLevels. With this well-prepared and consistent dataset, we are ready to move forward to the next phase of analysis, ensuring that our data pipeline is reliable and efficient.
