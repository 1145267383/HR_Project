# Project: Human Resources Dataset Analysis
________________________________________________

# Week 1:

## Overview the first week (A):
During this week (First) of the project, we built a robust data model, then created a DataBase, Inserted into it the dataset, and ensured that the DataBase was consistent and ready for analysis. 
The DB consists of employee information, education levels, satisfaction RatingLevels, Performance Rating, and other essential metrics necessary for HR analysis.

## Data Model and Creating DataBase.
The dataset tables were organized into relational DB to maintain consistency and enable efficient querying. The tables in relational 
 DB included:

### **A) Fact Tables:
- **Employees**: Contains essential employee details, including name, gender, department, salary, and employment history.
- **PerformanceRating**: Stores details about each employee's performance Rating, including satisfaction RatingLevels and self/manager RatingLevels.

### B) Dimension Tables:
- **EducationLevels**: Stores various education levels (e.g., Bachelors, Masters).
- **SatisfactionLevels**: Describes different satisfaction levels for the work environment, job, and relationships.
- **RatingLevels**: Contains rating levels such as "Meets Expectation" and "Above and Beyond."


The relationships between these tables are governed by foreign keys, ensuring data integrity across the system. For instance, employee satisfaction and rating data are linked to their respective levels via foreign key relationships to the `SatisfactionLevels` and `RatingLevels` tables.

### Tools Used:
- **SQL**: For Creating a Database, Insert the Dataset, data validation, relationship checks, and querying.

## (2) Data Cleaning:
After building the data model, we proceeded with data cleaning and preprocessing. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key observations:

- The data had no missing values or unusual entries across all tables. Each field, such as age, salary, and years of experience, showed values within expected ranges.
- Data entries for categorical variables like gender, marital status, and job roles were consistent without any spelling or formatting issues.
- Date fields, such as the employee `HireDate` and `ReviewDate` in the performance review table, were in the correct format and adhered to the expected chronological order.
- Numeric fields, including `Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `DistanceFromHome`, were confirmed to contain only valid numbers without any outliers or inconsistent values.

## Conclusion:
The dataset was thoroughly examined and found to be clean, consistent, and aligned with the designed data model. 
There were no missing values, illogical entries, or repeated values, ensuring data integrity across all tables. 
Also, the datasets were saved in one CSV file `06-All_Data_Employees.csv` for EDA and Visual Dashboard.


- **Python (pandas, Matplotlib)**: For detailed data Cleaning and visual inspection.

# Week 2:

## Overview the second weeK:
In the second week of this project, we focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key questions related to employee retention. This phase aimed to determine how various factors, such as salary, job satisfaction, and overtime, impact the likelihood of employees leaving the company.

_________________________________

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) And Data Analysis Questions:

Based on the company's interest in studying factors influencing employee retention, the following key questions were posed:

1. **Do employees who live more than 20 miles away `DistanceFromHome` have a higher tendency to leave the company `Attrition`?**
   
2. **Are employees with higher satisfaction levels at work `EnvironmentSatisfactionLevel` more likely to stay with the company `Attrition`?**

3. **Do more `TrainingOpportunitiesTaken` reduce the likelihood of an employee leaving the company `Attrition`?**

4. **Does an increase in salary `Salary` positively impact employee retention `Attrition`?**

5. **Does working `OverTime` negatively impact employee retention `Attrition`?**

6. **Is there a correlation between employee `Gender` and retention rate `Attrition`?**

7. **Are employees who frequently travel for business `BusinessTravel` more likely to leave the company `Attrition` than others?**

_________________________________

## Results:

1. `Distance From Home` exceeding 20 miles does not have a significant impact on employee turnover.
   
2. `Job Satisfaction` does not show a clear influence on whether employees stay with the company.

3. `Training Opportunities` provided to employees do not significantly affect their retention rates.

4. `Salary` increases positively influence employee retention, with higher salaries leading to longer tenures at the company.

5. `OverTime` has a negative impact on employee retention, with those working overtime more likely to leave.

6. There is a relationship between `Gender` and retention rates. Female employees are less likely to leave the company compared to male employees.

7. Employees who frequently engage in `Business Travel` are more likely to leave the company than those who travel less often.

_________________________________

## Summary

The analysis revealed that `Salary` increases and `Gender` are significant factors influencing employee retention. Higher salaries are associated with longer employee tenures, and female employees tend to have a lower attrition rate than male employees. Meanwhile, `OverTime` and frequent `Business Travel` were linked to higher turnover rates. 

However, other factors such as `Job Satisfaction`, `Distance From Home`, and `Training Opportunities` did not show a clear impact on employee retention. 

While these insights provide useful information, further detailed analysis and verification are needed to better understand the complex dynamics between these variables and employee retention.

# Week 3:

## Overview the third week:

In the third week of this project, the focus shifts to **Data Preprocessing**, **Machine Learning Model Selection**, and **Model Training, Validation, and Testing**. This phase is crucial for building predictive models that can help understand and forecast employee retention.

_________________________________

## (1) Data Preprocessing

Before applying machine learning models, the data needs to be cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key steps:

- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables such as `Gender`, `BusinessTravel`, and `JobRole` were encoded using methods like **One-Hot Encoding** or **Label Encoding** to make them usable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Feature Scaling**: Continuous variables such as `Salary`, `YearsAtCompany`, and `Age` were normalized using standardization techniques to ensure they contribute equally to the model.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset was divided into training and testing sets, ensuring that a separate portion of the data would be used to validate the model performance.

## (2) Model Selection and Training

After preparing the data, the next step was to choose a suitable machine learning model. Several models were considered:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**: A baseline model for binary classification, used to predict whether an employee will leave (`Attrition`).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A simple model based on proximity, used for classifying data based on the closest neighbors.
- **Decision Tree (DT)**: A tree-based model used to determine decision paths, known for its interpretability and ease of use.
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**: Utilized for its ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Naive Bayes (NB)**: A probabilistic model used for classification, particularly effective for text data.
- **Random Forest (RF)**: An ensemble method known for handling large datasets and providing good accuracy while reducing overfitting.

We used cross-validation techniques to evaluate the models and select the best performing one based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
