# Project: Human Resources Dataset Analysis

## Overview
In the second week of this project, we focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key questions related to employee retention. This phase aimed to determine how various factors, such as salary, job satisfaction, and overtime, impact the likelihood of employees leaving the company.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) And Data Analysis Questions:

Based on the company's interest in studying factors influencing employee retention, the following key questions were posed:

1. **Do employees who live more than 20 miles away `DistanceFromHome` have a higher tendency to leave the company `Attrition`?**
   
2. **Are employees with higher satisfaction levels at work `EnvironmentSatisfactionLevel` more likely to stay with the company `Attrition`?**

3. **Do more `TrainingOpportunitiesTaken` reduce the likelihood of an employee leaving the company `Attrition`?**

4. **Does an increase in salary `Salary` positively impact employee retention `Attrition`?**

5. **Does working `OverTime` negatively impact employee retention `Attrition`?**

6. **Is there a correlation between employee `Gender` and retention rate `Attrition`?**

7. **Are employees who frequently travel for business `BusinessTravel` more likely to leave the company `Attrition` than others?**

## Results:

1. `Distance From Home` exceeding 20 miles does not have a significant impact on employee turnover.
   
2. `Job Satisfaction` does not show a clear influence on whether employees stay with the company.

3. `Training Opportunities` provided to employees do not significantly affect their retention rates.

4. `Salary` increases positively influence employee retention, with higher salaries leading to longer tenures at the company.

5. `OverTime` has a negative impact on employee retention, with those working overtime more likely to leave.

6. There is a relationship between `Gender` and retention rates. Female employees are less likely to leave the company compared to male employees.

7. Employees who frequently engage in `Business Travel` are more likely to leave the company than those who travel less often.

## Summary

The analysis revealed that `Salary` increases and `Gender` are significant factors influencing employee retention. Higher salaries are associated with longer employee tenures, and female employees tend to have a lower attrition rate than male employees. Meanwhile, `OverTime` and frequent `Business Travel` were linked to higher turnover rates. 

However, other factors such as `Job Satisfaction`, `Distance From Home`, and `Training Opportunities` did not show a clear impact on employee retention. 

While these insights provide useful information, further detailed analysis and verification are needed to better understand the complex dynamics between these variables and employee retention.
